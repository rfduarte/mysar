News for the version 2.0.12 importer

* added support for disable the daemon from running, using the Administrative panel
* added support for disable the DNS resolver
* configuration is now saved on a config file, no more hard-coded
* the resolver has been improved, dont try to resolve the hostname at every database insert,
  and if the host is already resolved, dont try to resolve again.
* fixed a bug in the -s switch, where the current db insertions are printed on the screen. 
  more than 1000 insertions at a second, caused a division by zero. now it works  
* minor bug corrected, and many cleanups on the code.
* GCC 3.3.4 had some problems compiling

News for the version 2.0.12.1 importer

* fixed a bug in configuration file loader, sometimes random segfaults happened.
* Added support for loading compressed gzip logfiles (Still under Testing!!!)
  Only works in command line mode. Use the -z logfile.gz as argument.
* Added support for importing only summaries. no extra data is imported, only domains
  and sizes are imported. You cant see the files that were downloaded.
  Enabling this option, will reduce database size and import time. Useful for BIG logfiles.
* Schema Version test. If the importer detects a different Version on the database, it will
  quit and show a warning message. running on versions prior to 2.0.7 will not work, AFAIK.

News for the version 2.0.12.2 importer

* Database create support. using the -g switch, its possible to create a new, replace
  a database ony any server running mysql.

News for the version 2.0.12.3 importer

* Changed the -c switch to -z
* Rewritten the token splitting routine to a better one. now is crash proof and does not
  make use of strtok(), which is deprecated.
* debug core routines written
* Import time reduced 5%. 1 million records on a local mysql server, in 15 minutes with DNS
  resolving enabled and traffic importing activated.
* code cleanups, and reorganization. Core functions now always start with MySAR_
* Testing releases will compile with the -g -O0 flag. no performance flags, optimized only for debuggin'
  if you want to have performance, modify the Makefile, and change the value

News for the version 2.0.12.4 importer

* fixed a leak in the split routine, where old data could be reached in memory.
* MySAR_print_msg accept bitwise parameters now
* Massive code organization
* command line parameters now use getopt_long
* debug can be enabled or disabled now
* Some obscure errors fixed, specially with globals variables getting uninitialized.
* Mysql variables are not global now.
* added two fields to the database layout, lastLogOffset and firstLogTimestamp
* updated inCache code fields with the last information from squid wiki
* logfile offset save/load now implemented, no need to date compare every record on startup.
* Zero bytes records are discarded now, increasing processing power
* sql.c reorganization. no code repeating.
* moved MySAR_print_msg to MySAR_print
* removed the update traffic code, it was useless. code now first get UserID and SiteID before insert.
* Database optimizer coded. it runs when the number of kept days is reached. eg: at every 32 days.
  the optimizer can also be executed by command line, with --optimizedb
* A bug showed up when splitting the domain from URL, fixed.
* Lock file support.
* --kill: sends a stop signal to a running importer, eg: had been launched by cron, and you want to stop it, without losing
  all its progress. this will halt it, and save all progress. the new launched importer will continue the work, where the killed one
  stopped.
* Domain grouping support. this prevents from the importer generating lots of repeated sub-domains on sites
  viewer. the site viewer will show the main domain, and on details sub-domains will be included.
  the traffic sizes are all summed for the main domain.
  
  eg: with grouping:
       domain.com (sites view)
       |
       \_ images.domain.com  (details view)
       \_ report.domain.com  (details view)
       \_ xxx.img.domain.com (details view)

  without grouping:
       domain.com         (sites view)
       images.domain.com  (sites view)
       report.domain.com  (sites view)
       xxx.img.domain.com (sites view)

* package now uses GNU Automake & Autoconf, for an easy deploy.
* I forgot some things.... :-)
