MySAR 2.0.X INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
ATTENTION: Users of MySAR-1.X should read the UPGRADE file found in mysar's root directory instead!


You should already have:
- A working MySQL server.
- A working Apache web server with PHP4 installed
- A working squid proxy server.

MySAR has a web-based installation wizard, so all you have to do at first is setup the web-based functionality of the program first and the wizard will guide you for the rest.

- Become root. For example:
	su -
  If your system is Ubuntu Linux, run the following instead:
  	sudo bash

- Download the latest version of MySAR. Instructions can be found at http://giannis.stoilis.gr/software/mysar/.
  
- Extract this file to /usr/local/. For example:
  	tar zxvf mysar-2.0.6.tar.gz -C /usr/local
  	
- Configure your Apache Web Server to point the /mysar/ directory to the local directory /usr/local/mysar/www/.
  For Debian-based systems and Apache2:
	ln -s /usr/local/mysar/etc/mysar.apache /etc/apache2/conf.d/mysar
	/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
  All others should act accordingly, or put the contents of etc/mysar.apache file somewhere in the Apache configuration.
	
- Point your browser to the /mysar/ directory of your server and follow the instructions, for example:
	http://localhost/mysar/

- AFTER finishing the above procedure, you need to add the appropriate entries in etc/mysar.cron in your cron file. For systems having an /etc/cron.d directory, this can by as simple as running the following command:
	ln -s /usr/local/mysar/etc/mysar.cron /etc/cron.d/mysar

- Since MySAR 2.0.13, a new C importer is provided in mysar/bin/mysar-binary-importer-v4/. It is faster and lighter and hopefully will completely replace the PHP one. Compile it, configure its /usr/local/etc/mysar.conf and change /usr/local/mysar/etc/mysar.cron accordingly.

If you have any problems during(or after...) the installation, be sure to check the website for updates, frequently asked questions or support information. MySAR project now has a forum and a mailing list, try asking your questions there before contacting me directly.
