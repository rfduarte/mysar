UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
MySAR now uses a "wizard" to handle the installation. It should work fine, but be sure to backup your database before proceeding. It is recommended that you purge your existing database, to avoid any upgrade problems.


Follow these steps:

- Become root. For example:
	su -
  If your system is Ubuntu Linux, run the following instead:
  	sudo bash

- Move your current mysar directory out of the way. For example:
	mv /usr/local/mysar /usr/local/mysar1.old
If you are upgrading from a 2.0.X version, remember to keep you etc/config.ini file!
  
- Download the latest version of mysar from http://giannis.stoilis.gr/software/mysar/.

- Extract this file to /usr/local/. For example:
  	tar zxvf mysar-latest.tar.gz -C /usr/local

- Since MySAR 2.0.13, a new C importer is provided in mysar/bin/mysar-binary-importer-v4/. It is faster and lighter and hopefully will completely replace the PHP one. Compile it, configure its /usr/local/etc/mysar.conf and change /usr/local/mysar/etc/mysar.cron accordingly.
  	
- Your should already have your Apache configured to point the "/mysar/" directory to the local directory "/usr/local/mysar/www/". So, just point your browser to the "/mysar/" directory of your server and follow the instructions, for example:
	http://localhost/mysar/

If you have any problems during(or after...) the installation, be sure to check the website for updates, frequently asked questions or support information. Mysar project now has a forum and a mailing list, try asking your questions there before contacting me directly.
